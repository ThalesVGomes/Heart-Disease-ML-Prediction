# Heart-Disease-ML-Prediction
My solution to a Kaggle challenge - https://www.kaggle.com/dileep070/heart-disease-prediction-using-logistic-regression

I have performed an exploratory data analysis and built a machine learning model using:
* Logistic Regression
* KNN
* Naive Bayes
* Support Vector Machine
* AdaBoost
* XGBoost
* RandomForest
* Emsemble Voting Classifier

All models had their hyperparameters tunned.
The chosen metric to optimize was RECALL given the problem complexity

This notebook is also available on Kaggle in the Code session

Feel free to contact me for any suggestions
